APRS device identification database
======================================

This is a machine-readable index of APRS device and software identification
strings.  For easy manual editing and validation, the master file is in YAML
format, but conversions to other formats (XML, JSON, CSV) are
straightforward and will be provided a bit later.

This list is maintained by Hessu, OH7LZB, for the aprs.fi service.  It is
licensed under the CC BY-SA 2.0 license, so you're free to use it in any of
your applications.  For free.  Just mention the source somewhere in the
small print.
